## Unique features 

Chrome was refusing to cooperate for a few days so after all this time I finally got it to resemble my original idea, but basically the particles are created randomyly in a spherical shape and converge at a point (at the sprite characters hands), are deleted, and shoot off one big particle! Theres a short powering up animation to couple it as well ( kind of like what was done in explosion).
